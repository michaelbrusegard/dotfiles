# Dotfiles

To get started, clone the repository into the home directory:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/michaelbrusegard/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

When finished switch to use SSH for the repository:

```zsh
cd ~/dotfiles && git remote set-url origin git@github.com:michaelbrusegard/dotfiles.git
```

**Heads-up:** The dotfiles in this repository are incomplete because I also maintain private dotfiles with sensitive information that I want to keep secure. The setup for the private dotfiles is the same.

## Arch

### Creating symlinks for the config files

```zsh
cd ~/dotfiles/arch && stow -t ~ home && sudo stow -t /etc etc
```

## MacOS

Before setting up MacOS, System Intergrity Protection (SIP) needs to be partially disabled for the [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection) tiling window manager to work correctly.

1. Turn off the mac, then press and hold the power button until "Loading startup options" appears.
   Click Options, then click Continue.

2. In the menu bar, choose `Utilities`, then `Terminal`

3. Run this:

```zsh
csrutil enable --without fs --without debug --without nvram
```

Then go through each script below making sure it completes correctly before running the next.

### Installing apps & utilities using homebrew
