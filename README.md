## MacOS

Before setting up MacOS, System Intergrity Protection (SIP) needs to be partially disabled for the [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Disabling-System-Integrity-Protection) tiling window manager to work correctly.

1. Turn off the mac, then press and hold the power button until "Loading startup options" appears.
   Click Options, then click Continue.

2. In the menu bar, choose `Utilities`, then `Terminal`

3. Run this:

```zsh
csrutil enable --without fs --without debug --without nvram
```

Then go through each script below making sure it completes correctly before running the next.
